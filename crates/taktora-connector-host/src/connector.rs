//! The framework's [`Connector`] trait. `REQ_0220`–`REQ_0224`.
//!
//! Implementations live in protocol crates (e.g.
//! `taktora-connector-mqtt`, `taktora-connector-ethercat`). The trait is
//! intentionally not dyn-compatible — it carries associated `Routing` /
//! `Codec` types plus generic-on-`T` methods. Heterogeneous
//! collections of connectors are handled at the host level via the
//! [`crate::ConnectorHost::register`] entry point, which takes one
//! concrete connector at a time and runs its registration logic
//! against the host's [`taktora_executor::Executor`].

/// Implementations carry their own `Routing` type (`REQ_0224`) and pick
/// a `PayloadCodec` (`REQ_0211`). Both are associated types so the
/// connector's [`create_writer`](Connector::create_writer) /
/// [`create_reader`](Connector::create_reader) methods can return
/// concrete `ChannelWriter<T, Codec, N>` / `ChannelReader<T, Codec, N>`

/// The trait is `Send + 'static` because connectors cross thread
/// boundaries between the [`taktora_executor::Executor`]'s `WaitSet`
/// thread and the connector's internal tokio sidecar (where
/// applicable). It is **not** `Sync` — concrete connectors typically
/// hold an `Arc` to their shared state internally and expose only
/// `&self` methods that derive cheap clones.
