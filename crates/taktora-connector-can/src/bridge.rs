//! Bounded bridges between the taktora-executor side (plugin) and the
//! tokio sidecar (gateway). `REQ_0606`–`REQ_0608`.
//!
//! * [`OutboundBridge`] — plugin → gateway. Saturation surfaces as
//!   [`OutboundError::BackPressure`] (`REQ_0607`).
//! * [`InboundBridge`] — gateway → plugin. Saturation surfaces as
//!   [`InboundOutcome::Dropped`] carrying the running dropped-count
//!   so the gateway can emit `HealthEvent::DroppedInbound { count }`
//!   (`REQ_0608`).
//!
//! Identical shape to `taktora_connector_ethercat::bridge` (which is
//! itself identical to `taktora_connector_zenoh::bridge`); the only
//! reason this isn't a shared helper crate is that the framework
//! deliberately keeps bridges connector-local so each crate can pick
//! its own message type without dragging a generic dep.
