//! [`CanHealthMonitor`] — wraps `taktora_connector_core::HealthMonitor`

//! `REQ_0530`, `REQ_0535`.
//!
//! Aggregation rule (`REQ_0530`): the externally-visible
//! [`ConnectorHealth`] is the worst of every iface's sub-state.
//!
//! * Every iface `Up` ⇒ connector `Up`.
//! * Some iface `Degraded` (others `Up`) ⇒ connector `Degraded`.
//! * Some iface `Down` but ≥ 1 `Up` ⇒ connector `Degraded` (iface
//!   down is degraded service overall, not total loss).
//! * All ifaces `Down` ⇒ connector `Down`.
//! * Mixed `Connecting` / `Up` during bring-up ⇒ connector
//!   `Connecting` until at least one iface is `Up`.
