//! [`EthercatHealthMonitor`] — thin wrapper around `HealthMonitor`.
//!
//! Broadcasts every emitted `HealthEvent` over a `crossbeam_channel`
//! so observers (e.g. `EthercatConnector::subscribe_health`) can
//! listen.
//!
//! The wrapper centralises two concerns the bare `HealthMonitor` does
//! not own:
//!
//! 1. Thread-safe access. The bare monitor is `&mut`-only; the gateway
//!    side typically holds it behind a `Mutex` because both the tokio
//!    sidecar and the executor's `WaitSet` thread observe / mutate
//!    health.
//! 2. Fan-out. Every successful transition is rebroadcast to one or
//!    more subscribers via a `crossbeam_channel::Sender`.
