//! [`CycleRunner`] — composes [`BusDriver`], [`CycleScheduler`],
//! [`evaluate_wkc`], and [`EthercatHealthMonitor`] into one
//! cycle-driving unit.
//!
//! The runner owns the driver by value; the health monitor is shared
//! via `Arc` so the plugin side ([`crate::EthercatConnector`])
//! observes the same transitions as the gateway side that drives
//! them.
//!
//! Tests use `MockBusDriver` to verify the runner's end-to-end
//! behaviour — bring-up transitions `Connecting → Up`, matching WKC
//! keeps the connector `Up`, mismatching WKC transitions to
//! `Degraded { reason }` with the cycle index in the reason
//! (`REQ_0319` / `REQ_0320`), and the scheduler enforces
//! skip-not-catch-up semantics (`REQ_0317`).
