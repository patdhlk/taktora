//! [`BusDriver`] — the trait abstraction every concrete EtherCAT
//! cycle-driving back-end implements. Carved out in C5d so the
//! cycle-loop integration tests don't depend on real EtherCAT
//! hardware.
//!
//! Two known implementations:
//!
//! * [`crate::MockBusDriver`] — synthetic SubDevices, programmable
//!   working-counter sequences, no hardware. Used by the in-tree
//!   integration tests under `tests/runner.rs`.
//! * `EthercrabBusDriver` — wraps `ethercrab::MainDevice`, spawns
//!   `tx_rx_task`, drives the bus through PRE-OP → SAFE-OP → OP
//!   per `REQ_0312` / `REQ_0313` / `REQ_0315`. Tracked as a
//!   follow-on commit ("C5e") — its API requires hardware
//!   iteration to verify, and the trait abstraction defined here is
//!   the integration point that lets `EthercrabBusDriver` land
//!   incrementally without breaking existing tests.
//!
//! Trait methods are async because real bus operations (ethercrab's
//! `tx_rx`, SDO writes) are async-first. The cycle loop lives on the
//! [`crate::EthercatGateway`]'s tokio runtime, so async at the trait
//! boundary keeps the integration natural.
