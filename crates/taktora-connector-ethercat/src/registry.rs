//! Per-channel routing registry used by the gateway's cycle loop.
//! `REQ_0328`.
//!
//! The registry maps each open [`ChannelDescriptor`] (plugin-side
//! call to `Connector::create_writer` / `create_reader`) to its
//! [`EthercatRouting`] + direction so the cycle loop can iterate it
//! once per cycle, draining outbound bridges into PDI bytes and
//! repopulating inbound iceoryx2 services from PDI bytes.
//!
//! Two properties drive the data structure choice:
//!
//! 1. **Stable insertion-order iteration** — the cycle loop must
//!    visit channels in a deterministic order so test fixtures
//!    (and production observability) can predict the dispatch
//!    sequence.
//! 2. **No per-cycle heap allocation** — `Vec::iter()` returns a
//!    `slice::Iter` that allocates nothing. Registration uses
//!    `Vec::push` (which may allocate at construction time only if
//!    capacity is exceeded), but the cycle loop only ever calls
//!    `iter()`. Combined with `with_capacity` at construction, the
//!    steady state is alloc-free per `REQ_0060`.
//!
