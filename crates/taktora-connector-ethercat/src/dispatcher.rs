//! Gateway-side dispatcher. `REQ_0326`, `REQ_0327`, `REQ_0328`.
//!
//! Composes [`pdi::write_routing`] / [`pdi::read_routing`] +
//! [`ChannelRegistry`] + the iceoryx2 raw pub/sub ports into the
//! actual byte-shovel between iceoryx2 and the EtherCAT PDI.
//!
//! Two surfaces:
//!
//! * [`dispatch_one_cycle`] — synchronous, single-iteration form used
//!   by integration tests to drive deterministic round-trips
//!   (`TEST_0220` / `TEST_0221` / `TEST_0222`). The test owns the
//!   [`CycleRunner`] and feeds the dispatcher cycle-by-cycle.
//! * [`dispatcher_loop`] — long-running `async fn` spawned by
//!   `EthercatConnector::register_with` (`REQ_0321`). The loop calls
//!   `dispatch_one_cycle` on the gateway's tokio runtime and sleeps
//!   until the next cycle deadline.
//!
//! The trait-object wrappers [`IoxOutboundDrain`] / [`IoxInboundPublish`]
//! erase the channel's user-type `T` and codec `C` from the
//! [`ChannelBinding`] so the registry stores heterogeneous channels
//! in a single `Vec`. The codec never runs on the dispatcher path —
//! payload decoding stays in the plugin's
//! [`taktora_connector_transport_iox::ChannelReader::try_recv`].
