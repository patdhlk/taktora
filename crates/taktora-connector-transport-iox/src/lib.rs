//! iceoryx2-backed envelope transport for the taktora-connector framework.
//!
//! Implements [`BB_0002`](../../spec/architecture/connector.rst):
//!
//! * [`ConnectorEnvelope`] — POD wire format (`REQ_0200`, `REQ_0202`,
//!   `REQ_0203`, `REQ_0204`).
//! * [`ChannelWriter`] — zero-copy publisher using
//!   [`iceoryx2::port::publisher::Publisher::loan_uninit`] so the codec
//!   writes its bytes directly into shared memory (`REQ_0205`).
//! * [`ChannelReader`] — subscriber that decodes the envelope payload
//!   into `T` and surfaces codec errors as
//!   [`taktora_connector_core::ConnectorError::Codec`] (`REQ_0214`).
//! * [`ServiceFactory`] — opens / creates the iceoryx2 pub/sub service
//!   for a given [`taktora_connector_core::ChannelDescriptor`]
//!   (`REQ_0206`).
//!
//! The `Connector` trait itself (`REQ_0220`) lives in the host crate
//! `taktora-connector-host` because its method surface ties together
//! transport-iox handles with health subscription and lifecycle control
//! — concerns this crate intentionally does not own.
