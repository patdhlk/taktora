//! Abstraction trait over real and mock Zenoh sessions, plus the
//! Zenoh-private 1-byte reply framing helpers.
//!
//! The trait shape covers BOTH pub/sub and query operations so that
//! `ZenohConnector`, `ZenohGateway`, and the query handles (added in
//! later stages) can monomorphise over either back-end without
//! re-defining the surface. Z1 lands the trait + frame helpers only;
//! `MockZenohSession` (in `mock.rs`) implements pub/sub fully and
//! stubs out query operations as `NotImplemented` until Z3.
