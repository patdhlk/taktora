//! Bounded bridges between the taktora-executor side (plugin) and the
//! tokio sidecar (gateway).
//!
//! * [`OutboundBridge`] — plugin → gateway. Saturation surfaces as
//!   [`OutboundError::BackPressure`] (`REQ_0404`, `REQ_0405`).
//! * [`InboundBridge`] — gateway → plugin. Saturation surfaces as
//!   [`InboundOutcome::Dropped`] carrying the running dropped-count
//!   so the gateway can emit `HealthEvent::DroppedInbound { count }`
//!   (`REQ_0404`, `REQ_0406`).
//!
//! The shape of the two types is intentionally identical to
//! `taktora_connector_ethercat::bridge` — `REQ_0404`/`0405`/`0406` are
//! the direct analogs of `REQ_0322`/`0323`/`0324`, and a unified shape
//! keeps the framework-level health-emission logic uniform.
