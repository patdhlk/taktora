//! Observable health for every connector — [`ConnectorHealth`] enum,
//! [`HealthEvent`] emitted on every transition, and [`HealthMonitor`]
//! that gates transitions against the `ARCH_0012` state machine.
//!
//! State machine (`ARCH_0012`):
//!
//! ```text
//!   [start] → Connecting
//!   Connecting → Up | Down
//!   Up → Degraded | Down | [shutdown]
//!   Degraded → Up | Connecting | Down
//!   Down → Connecting | [shutdown]
//! ```
//!
//! The `Degraded → Connecting` edge supports recovery loops that
//! re-bring the underlying stack while the connector is degraded
//! (e.g. `REQ_0331` — `EtherCAT` cycle failure triggers
//! `BusDriver::recover` per policy; the connector emits a
//! `Connecting` transition while the recovery is in flight).
//!
//! Same-discriminant transitions (e.g. `Up → Up`) are illegal — they
//! indicate a bug at the call site (the caller failed to debounce or
//! checked the wrong condition).
